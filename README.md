# poledance.xyz | transforming your movement ðŸ’ƒ (x,y,z)'s like a-b-c!

Poledance.xyz is an online platform designed for managing solo choreography in the field of pole fitness. It employs a data science framework to distill complex movements into simplified terms and generate reports that systematically codify a dance. The beta version features:

1. An online dictionary and visualization tools for domain-specific dance movements.
2. An online diary for users to upload videos and receive personalized reports with statistics.
3. Documented data processing and algorithm development steps.

Key achievements:
1. Collecting and labeling images and videos for a diverse dataset.
2. Integrating kinematic data to analyze poses using Mediapipe Pose Landmarker Task
3. Creating plot and figure aesthetics to convey pattern and insights
4. Simple error analysis from a single user to refine future development
